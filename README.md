**VERSION CONTROL**<br> 
Version Control is a system that manages changes to a file or project over time. It is used for tracking changes as well as who made the changes, the time it was made and also gives a little information regarding the change. 

Version control promotes collaboration by allowing different individuals work on a particular project concurrently, after which they merge their individual inputs to form a whole. It can also be said to be a form of backup, where past versions of a project are preserved and easily recovered on ocassions of loss.

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB**<br>
**Git** is a distributed Version Control System that is used for tracking changes in a source code during software development. it is used locally on a developers device. With git, developers work independently on their local device and push their code to a central platform.<br>
**GitHub** on the other hand is a web-based hosting platform/service for git folders /repositories. It is the central platform to which developers push their source codes for the sake of collaboration, review, sharing and management.
